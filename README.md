# weekend-workout
Just logging my weekend programming workouts...

One Saturday morning I figured I'd probably like to save my weekend coding workouts for future reference and bouts of professional self-loathing. Oh, and historical purposes as well, probably. 10 years from now, I'll probably look back at the early logs and think: "By Minerva, what was I thinking?.."

Also, if you are viewing this repo and have suggestions or would like to point out the fallacies and errs in my code, please feel free to do so. I'd take mental "beating" over eternal ignorance any time of the day...

Some are missing tests, I know. Tests first, I agree. But sometimes I just want to do some coding with only manual testing involved. Hope, you can forgive me my inadequacy.

Today I started using CuTest by Asim Jalis to write C specs for my workout. Please, I am **not** the author of CuTest, - Asim Jalis is. The code written by me, that makes use of the Asim's library contains the `cutest_license.txt` file and references the original author. You can discover more about CuTest on the project's homepage at http://cutest.sourceforge.net/
